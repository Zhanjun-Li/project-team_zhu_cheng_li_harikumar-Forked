Admin can manage all possible services that can be offered to patients and will be able to 
create,edit,remove services to be offered by walk-in clinics.

## LESSONS LEARNED
We've learned lots of lessons, simply because we made lots of mistakes,
When doing the deliverables, we should always have the blue print of the
final project in mind, not just finishing a deliverable to meet the deadline.
All group members should closely follow the project or else they might find 
great difficulties catching up afterwards.

But Overall, we've learned a lot through doing the project. We've fimiliarize ourselves 
with Android studio, GitHub, Circle CI, Umple and other softwares. We also learned how to 
work as a team and communicate our ideas. Most importanly, we've learned how far off we are
from a real soft ware engineer and more efforts are needed in our future studies.
